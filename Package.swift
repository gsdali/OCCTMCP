// swift-tools-version: 6.0
//
// OCCTMCP — Swift port of the Node MCP server. Coexists with the original
// TypeScript implementation under src/ during the migration; once feature
// parity is reached the Node code can be removed.
//
// SwiftPM expects test sources under Tests/<TargetName>, but this repo's
// existing TypeScript test directory is `tests/` and the volume is
// case-insensitive (APFS default), so we point SPM at SwiftTests/ to avoid
// the clash.
